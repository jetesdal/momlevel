Testing Philosophy
------------------
Sea level analysis inherently requires a high level of precision. Locally, many of the climate change-driven sea level changes over the historical period are on the same order of magnitude as other natural drivers (e.g. vertical land motion). The **momlevel** package provided extensive unit testing to maintain this precision and ensure quality. All new contributions require unit tests be written using **pytest**.
